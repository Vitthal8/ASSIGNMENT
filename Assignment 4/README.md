# Python File Handling Tasks

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors (`Task1.py`)
In `Task1.py`, we read the contents of `sample.txt` line by line. We also removed the extra newline characters (`\n`) using the string `replace()` method to ensure the output is formatted cleanly.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File (`Task2.py`)
In `Task2.py`, we write initial text into `output.txt` using write mode (`'w'`). Then, we use append mode (`'a'`) to add new lines of text to the end of the file without overwriting the original content.
